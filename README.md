# Investigation-of-the-Patterns-of-Pedestrian-Fatalities-Project

  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2020, there were 6,516 pedestrians killed in traffic crashes, a 3.9-percent increase from the 6,272 pedestrian fatalities in 2019 [3]. This project investigates the increasing number of incidents of pedestrians being injured or killed on the roads, utilizing the extensive data provided by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) [4]. The growing concern over pedestrian safety demands a thorough analysis to identify the root causes of these incidents and to devise effective strategies for making our streets safer. By examining the FDOT data, which includes details on accident locations, timings, and victim demographics, we aim to uncover patterns and identify the primary factors contributing to these tragic events [1], [2], [4].
Our research focuses on identifying major risk factors for pedestrians, such as the most dangerous locations, times when accidents are more likely, and which demographic groups are most at risk. Understanding these trends will allow us to recommend specific measures to reduce these incidents, including infrastructure improvements, public education campaigns, and stricter enforcement of traffic laws [2].
Preliminary analyses suggest a correlation between pedestrian accidents and certain urban areas, specific times of day, and risky pedestrian behaviors. This evidence supports the need for a comprehensive approach to safety, combining physical roadway improvements, enhanced public awareness, and rigorous enforcement of traffic regulations [1].
The significance of this study lies in its potential to inform and shape policies that could significantly reduce pedestrian fatalities and injuries. It contributes to the broader goal of promoting safer urban environments where walking and cycling can be enjoyed without fear.
